# **Capital-Region-Refugees**
This website was created to help the Capital Region Refugees non-profit assist those who need help when first arrive to the US.

This website is sponsored by the Capital Region Refugee Roundtabe, a network of volounteers that provide support and assistance to the refugees that have resettled in the capital region.

## **Description**
This site is meant to be used by those looking for resources as refugees and/or those looking for an opportunity to volunteer to make refugees feel welcome and help them meet their needs.
Navigation of the site is based on the multiple dropdown menus at the top, each one re-dericting the user to a different page in the site.

## **Support**
Questions about the site? ideas to improve it? tips, pointers? feel free to contact me at marino.carranza@gmail.com

## **Roadmap**
This is an ongoing project, colors, layout, photos used are subject to change based on input recieved from Anne Carelli, which in turn recieves input from someone else.
I will be working on this site one page at a time, once the home page has been approved it will go live and then we will move on the the next one with the highest priority on the list.
At the moment the project is for the new volunteer group to take charge and government support.
